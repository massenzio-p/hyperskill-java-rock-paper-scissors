# Hyperskills Academy project: Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Stage 1/5: Unfair computer
Description
Rock paper scissors is a popular hand game. Two players simultaneously form one of three shapes with their hands, and then, depending on the shapes, one player wins â€” rock beats scissors, paper wins over rock, scissors defeats paper.
The game is well-known for fair win-conditions between equal options.

Let's start with an unfair version! :)

Write a program that reads input that states which option users have chosen. After this, your program must make users lose! That is, your program should always select an option that defeats the one picked by users. Once it finds this option, output the line Sorry, but the computer chose <option>, where <option> is the name of the option that the program's picked depending on the user's input.
For example, if users enter rock, the program should print Sorry, but the computer chose paper and so on.

Pay attention to the format of the output. It should follow the one in the example, including capital letters and punctuation. Do not print additional strings.

Just think about it: in this stage, the computer has to win every time.

if users choose paper, the computer chooses scissors (the computer wins);

if users choose scissors, the computer chooses rock (the computer wins);

if users choose rock, the computer chooses paper (the computer wins).

Objectives
Your program should:

Take input from the user;

Find an option that wins over the user's option;

Output the line: Sorry, but the computer chose <option>.

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

> scissors
Sorry, but the computer chose rock
Example 2:

> paper
Sorry, but the computer chose scissors

## Stage 2/5: Equalizing chances
Description
Well, now let's do something more tangible. Nobody wants to play the game where you always lose. We can use the power of the Random class to make the game a bit more challenging.

Write a program that reads input from users, chooses a random option, and then says who won: a user or the computer.
There are a few examples below to provide the output for any outcome (<option> is the option chosen by your program):

Loss: Sorry, but the computer chose <option>;
Draw: There is a draw (<option>);
Win: Well done. The computer chose <option> and failed;
Objectives
Your program should:

Read the user input that includes an option;
Choose a random option;
Compare the options and determine the winner;
Output one of the lines above depending on the result of the game.
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

> rock
Well done. The computer chose scissors and failed
Example 2:

> scissors
There is a draw (scissors)
Example 3:

> paper
Sorry, but the computer chose scissors

## Stage 4/5: Scoring the game
Description
People love to see their results as they're advancing to their goals. So, let's learn how to show the scoreboard!

When the game starts, users must be able to enter their names. After that, the program should greet users and read a file named rating.txt.

In order to execute the test program correctly, name the file rating.txt and save it in the current directory, without subdirectories. In tests this file will be created, pre-filled with data. Make sure that you read the data correctly when you start the game.

It is the file that contains the current scores for different players. You can see the file format below: lines containing usernames and their scores, divided by a single space:

Tim 350
Jane 200
Alex 400
Take the current user score from the file and use it as a basis for counting the score during the game. For example, if a user entered Tim, then their score at the start of the game is 350. If a user inputs a name that is not on the list, the program should count the score from 0.

No need to write anything to the rating.txt file.

Print the user score with the !rating command. For example, if your rating is 0, then the program should print:

Your rating: 0
Add 50 points for every draw, 100 for every win, and 0 for losing.

Objectives
Your program should:

Output a line Enter your name:. Users enter their names on the same line (not the one following the output!);

Read input with the name and output a new line: Hello, <name>

Read rating.txt and check whether it contains an entry with the current username. If yes, use the score specified in the file as a starting point. If not, start the score from 0.

Play the game by the rules defined in the previous stages and read the user input;

If the input is !exit, output Bye! and stop the game;

If the input is the name of the option, then pick a random option and output a line with the result in the following format (<option> is the name of the option chosen by the program):

Loss: Sorry, but the computer chose <option>

Draw: There is a draw (<option>)

Win: Well done. The computer chose <option> and failed

For each draw, add 50 points to the score. For each win, add 100 points. In case a user loses, don't change the score;

If the input corresponds to anything else, output Invalid input;

Restart the game.

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

Enter your name: > Tim
Hello, Tim
> !rating
Your rating: 350
> rock
Sorry, but the computer chose paper
> paper
Well done. The computer chose rock and failed
> scissors
There is a draw (scissors)
> !rating
Your rating: 500
> !exit
Bye!
Example 2:

Enter your name: > Chuck
Hello, Chuck
> scissors
There is a draw (scissors)
> rock
Well done. The computer chose scissors and failed
> paper
Well done. The computer chose rock and failed
> !rating
Your rating: 250
> !exit
Bye!
